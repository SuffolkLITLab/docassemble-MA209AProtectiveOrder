template: court_help_template
content: |
  You can get a 209A restraining order at the District Court near where you live
  or the Probate and Family Court in your county.  If you live in Boston, you
  can go to the Boston Municipal Court (BMC) near where you live instead of a
  District Court. You can also go to the Superior Court in your county.  Most
  people get 209A restraining orders from District Court, BMC, or Probate and
  Family Court.  Superior Court restraining orders are rare but may be an option
  when other available courts are closed due to the COVID-19 crisis. 
  
  If you have moved to another town in Massachusetts since the abuse, you can go
  to the court where you live now or to the court for an address that you had to
  leave because of the abuse. 
  
  Some things to think about when you are deciding which court is better for you
  are:  

  #### If the other parent wants to visit your child  
  The District Court is not supposed to order visitation between the other
  parent and your child as part of a 209A case. The Probate and Family Court can
  order visitation in a 209A case.  If you want to get visitation settled right
  away, you may want to go to the Probate and Family Court to file for the
  209A restraining order. If you do not want the court to decide about
  visitation, you might want to go to the District Court for your 209A
  restraining order. 
  #### If the person who abused you is facing criminal charges  
  If the person who abused you is facing criminal charges related to the
  domestic violence, you may want to file for your 209A restraining order at
  the District or Superior Court where that case is. That way, you may be able
  to work with the same Victim/Witness Advocate for both cases.
  #### If you are already in Probate and Family Court with another case  
  Sometimes, it is easier and less complicated to file your 209A Application in Probate and Family Court **if you already have a case going on there now**. If you file in District Court, they may have to get in touch with the Probate and Family Court - this back and forth may slow things down and take more time that you do not have.
