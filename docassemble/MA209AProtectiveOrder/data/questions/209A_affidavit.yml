  Your Affidavit
subquestion: |

  Show the judge that ${users.familiar()} needs this restraining order to be safe.

  Talk about how the abuse affected ${users.familiar()}.

  Show the judge you need this restraining order to help you be safe.
  
  In your own words, give enough details about the abuse so the judge has a picture in their mind. Your description is your "affidavit."
  
  % endif
  
  You should know that if the court does not "{impound}" your affidavit, your words will be public record. It is not easy, but if someone wants to go into court to find and read your affidavit, they can.
  
  Later, you will get a chance to ask the court to {impound} your affidavit.

terms:
  - impound: |
      "Impound" means the court will only let a few special people, like the judge, see a document. Anyone else must file a motion to ask for and give a very good reason for why they need to see the document. You use a Motion for Impoundment to tell the court it would be very dangerous for anyone else to see your affidavit. You will get a chance to include this motion in the forms you send to the court.
